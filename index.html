        <p>We believe there’s great power in community and mentorship, especially when it comes to changing careers. Your personal mentor isn’t just supervising from the sidelines, they’re working with you face-to-face, every day. They’re just as invested in your success as you are. They’ll help you get further faster by tailoring your curriculum to suit your schedule and specific job goals. 1-on-1 mentorship is hands-down a faster, more effective way to learn.</p>
